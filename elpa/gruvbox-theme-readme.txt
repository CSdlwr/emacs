 Using autothemer since 1.00

 A port of the Gruvbox colorscheme for Vim, built on top of the new built-in
 theme support in Emacs 24.

 This theme contains my own modifications and it's a bit opinionated
 sometimes, deviating from the original because of it. I try to stay
 true to the original as much as possible, however. I only make
 changes where I would have made the changes on the original.

 Since there is no direct equivalent in syntax highlighting from Vim to Emacs
 some stuff may look different, especially in stuff like JS2-mode, where it
 adds stuff that Vim doesn't have, in terms of syntax.

 Credits:

 Pavel Pertsev created the original theme for Vim, on which this port
 is based.

 Lee Machin created the first port of the original theme, which
 Greduan developed further adding support for several major modes.

 Jason Milkins (ocodo) has maintained the theme since 2015 and is
 working with the community to add further mode support and align
 the project more closely with Vim Gruvbox.
